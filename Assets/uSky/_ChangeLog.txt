uSky 1.0.0f2 Change Log
=======================
- Since Unity 5 beta 13 changed for a big and tessellated sphere mesh. Now some codes of uSky shader allows computing per-vertex based for better performance.
New update of the uSky shader that approximately run 10 ~ 20% faster. This performance gain is for Unity 5 beta 13 or newer users only, uSky shader for Unity 4 will remain the same.

* Note: Do not use the uSky shader for Unity 5 in Unity 4.x.x. 

- Removed the Directional Light in the Unity 5 uSkyRenderer Prefab. When apply this Prefab, user need to apply the Directional Light manually to uSkyRenderer.
(When Create or Start a new scene in Unity 5, default always included the Directional Light in the scene. So we removed it from Prefab for less confusion) 

- Small update on the uSkyRenderer.cs, better ground ambient between different color space.
